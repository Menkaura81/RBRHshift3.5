# RBRHshift3.5
Richard Burns Rally H Shifter plugin v3.5 (Original code by Racer_S)

Just added the option to select clutch bite point. How much % of the clutch needs to be pressed for allow gears to change.

Files modified:
  - shifter.h: Added bitepoint logic and ini file read and write compatibility for it.
  - RHBRTestPlugin.h: Chaged plugin menu to display new bitepoint option.
